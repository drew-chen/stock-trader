## Build Setup

Use or create a Firebase Realtime Database in **Test** mode. Further details can be found in [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start). Use your Firebase Database URL in [src/main.js](src/main.js). Finally,

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
